# About eggroll

EggRoll is a web app that lets users create and manage attendance events. Logged-in users can create events with a name and start time, and each event generates a unique attendance code. Attendees can submit this code to mark their attendance while the event is live. The app uses Supabase for authentication and database storage, with a React frontend and Express backend.
