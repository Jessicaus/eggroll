# About eggroll

EggRoll is a web app that lets users create and manage attendance events! Logged-in users can create events with a name and start time, and each event generates a unique attendance code. Attendees can submit this code to mark their attendance while the event is live.
Explore unique features such as:
- Toggle events between live/dead status to control when attendees can attend your event!
- Three unique views which organize your events
- Attendance Dashboard that changes based on your identity!
